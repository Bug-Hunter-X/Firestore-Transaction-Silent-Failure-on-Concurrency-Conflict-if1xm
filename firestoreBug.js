The issue arises when attempting to update a document in Firestore using a transaction and encountering a concurrency conflict.  The transaction fails silently without providing clear error messages, making debugging difficult.  The code appears correct, but the update isn't applied due to the unseen conflict.  The transaction.update() method returns a Promise that resolves, even though the update didn't succeed.
