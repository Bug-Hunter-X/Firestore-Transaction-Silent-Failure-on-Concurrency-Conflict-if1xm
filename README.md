# Firestore Transaction Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Firestore transactions where concurrency conflicts result in silent failures.  The transaction appears to succeed, but the document update is not applied.  The lack of clear error messages makes debugging challenging.

The `firestoreBug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `firestoreBugSolution.js` provides a solution implementing robust error handling and retries.

This issue highlights the importance of thorough error handling when working with Firestore transactions in concurrent environments.
